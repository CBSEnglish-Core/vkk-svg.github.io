							<p align="left">We are not just our mind. Our body is a part of us too. And hence, it is imperative that we make good use of it.' My inclination towards sports has been inherited from my dad. An ace sportsman himself, he could skillfully manoeuvre himself from one sport to another, gracefully. Sports teaches us a lot of life skills. The first lesson is to do our best and work to the best of our abilities. It helps us in coping with losses and failures and also to rejuvenate the stresses building inside us. I might not have won all the competitions that I participated in, but I tried my best. And that's fulfilling.</p>
