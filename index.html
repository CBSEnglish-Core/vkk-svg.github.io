							<h2 id="about"><strong><FONT COLOR="#1E90FF">WHO AM I</FONT></strong></h2>
							<p align="left"> I am Prajval, a profound thinker and creator. I have a dreamer in me who drifts off from reality into realms of thoughtfulness. It is from there that I fetch the raw materials of ideas that  I aspire to shape into reality. I consider myself to be a unique combination of sensitivity and technology. As a child, I used to talk to the lift and wondered whether it could talk to me. It was only later that we got Alexa. Even today, I try to conceptualize how gadgets may have emotions. </p>

							<h2 id="about"><strong><FONT COLOR="#1E90FF">INTERESTS</FONT></strong></h2>
							<p align="left">I have a researcher hidden in me. I nurture a secret desire of finding solutions to some of the most complex problems faced by the world. The idealist in me says that it is possible to eradicate pollution and replace it with pure air. While caught in a traffic jam once, I wondered if we could take all the smoke emitting vehicles underground and plant trees all over the surface. Furthermore,  if carbon dioxide could be separated into carbon and oxygen and reused. I was 10 at that time. </header>

							<h2 id="about"><strong><FONT COLOR="#1E90FF">MY AMBITION</FONT></strong></h2>
							<p align="left"> The dreamer in me craves for a world of sustainable development, with the least wastage of resources. I perceive myself to be a minuscule part of a giant machinery. Seemingly insignificant yet imperative for the functioning of the machine. Hence, for the social machinery to function smoothly, each member should exist peacefully. Helpfulness should thrive and enable people to lead a soothing, serene life. I aspire to find the rightful technological solutions for the problems that afflict the people of the world.</p>

							<p align="left">'We are not just our mind. Our body is a part of us too. And hence, it is imperative that we make good use of it.' My inclination towards sports has been inherited from my dad. An ace sportsman himself, he could skillfully manoeuvre himself from one sport to another, gracefully.  Sports teaches us a lot of life skills. The first lesson is to do our best and work to the best of our abilities. It helps us in coping with losses and failures and also to rejuvenate the stresses building inside us. I might not have won all the competitions that I participated in, but I tried my best. And that's fulfilling.</p>
