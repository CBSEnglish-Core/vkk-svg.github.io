							<h2 id="about"><strong>WHO AM I</strong></h2>
							<p align="left"> I am Prajval, a profound thinker and creator. I have a dreamer in me who drifts off from reality into realms of thoughtfulness. It is from there that I fetch the raw materials of ideas that  I aspire to shape into reality. I consider myself to be a unique combination of sensitivity and technology. As a child, I used to talk to the lift and wondered whether it could talk to me. It was only later that we got Alexa. Even today, I try to conceptualize how gadgets may have emotions. </p>

							<h2 id="about"><strong>INTERESTS</strong></h2>
							<p align="left">I have a researcher hidden in me. I nurture a secret desire of finding solutions to some of the most complex problems faced by the world. The idealist in me says that it is possible to eradicate pollution and replace it with pure air. While caught in a traffic jam once, I wondered if we could take all the smoke emitting vehicles underground and plant trees all over the surface. Furthermore,  if carbon dioxide could be separated into carbon and oxygen and reused. I was 10 at that time. </header>

							<h2 id="about"><strong>MY AMBITION</strong></h2>
							<p align="left"> The dreamer in me craves for a world of sustainable development, with the least wastage of resources. I perceive myself to be a minuscule part of a giant machinery. Seemingly insignificant yet imperative for the functioning of the machine. Hence, for the social machinery to function smoothly, each member should exist peacefully. Helpfulness should thrive and enable people to lead a soothing, serene life. I aspire to find the rightful technological solutions for the problems that afflict the people of the world.</p>

							<p align="left">Any society comprises of different sections. The most pronounced differences are the ones based on economic inequality. The affluent people have a choice to spend the money only on their own selves or to extend a part of the resources to the underprivileged.</p><p> Most of us choose to shut our eyes to the problems faced by those who canâ€™t afford even basic amenities. And that, primarily is the reason why we have not been able to remove disparities and make their lives even tolerably decent. Many live in squalid, unhygienic conditions, feed poorly, are malnourished, their children are victims of infanticide and they watch life slip past with helpless and morose eyes. .My induction into community service started at the age of one, when my parents. celebrated my first birthday in a spastic society school. Hence, I grew up nurturing a sense of empathy and compassion, feeling and realization that it is not just things and donations that either the physically or economically weaker section seeks but an understanding of their problems. If each one of us contributes not only in terms of money, but also in terms of service, we would eventually be able to bridge the gap, at least partly. I have lived in many Metropolitan cities and have often been taken aback by the cultural differences that exist within the country. And yet, mysteriously and mesmerizingly, there is an invisible thread that binds us all together as Indians. </p><p>I have understood this integration very well by living amid it and observing it closely. Inspired by all these real life interactions,  I founded the Changemakers club in School. This gave me a broad platform that helped me connect with like minded students. We addressed various issues of grave importance like 'hunger.' In association with the Robin Hood Army,  we were able to channelize food to the needy. We also addressed issues like stress management, peer pressure and bullying through interactive sessions. I joined the Interact club of Delhi Public School Ruby Park when I shifted to Kolkata and was a part of many reaching out drives.</p><p> I was associated with the Ashoka changemakers schools group at the age of 12 when I initiated the swachh Bharat (clean India) campaign in and around my school. I was awarded for my achievements by the Director Principal of R.N.Podar School, Ms. Avnita Bir. I spearheaded the swachh Bharat Abhiyan (Clean India Campaign) outside the school premises and a lot of children joined me. I was in class 7 at R.N. Podar School, Mumbai. I was also a part of the Versova beach cleaning campaign which gained worldwide acclaim later.</p><p> My induction into community service started at the age of one, when my parents. celebrated my first birthday in a spastic society school.
