							<p align="left">I have been very selective about my activities. People might say that I am reserved, but I’d like to say that I have been sure about my likes and dislikes since a very young age. I’ve tried my hand at various things ranging from music, art, drawing, craft, dance, dramatics, karate, skating (which I pursued since 4 years of age) cooking, abacus mathematics and I can’t remember any more. My mom used to take me from one class to another, waiting patiently and expectantly to see whether I liked a particular thing or not. I understood that my real passion lay in sports, especially Lawn Tennis and social work. I also discovered a culinary inclination in me since a very age. Maybe it is genetic because my father is an Executive Chef.</p>
